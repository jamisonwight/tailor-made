            <h3><strong>California Shine The Light Disclosure Information</strong></h3>
            <p>Although we do not disclose to any third parties for their marketing purposes any of your personal information, California residents are entitled to receive the following disclosure. If you are a resident of California: </p>
            <p>Under California Law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with which they have an established business relationship: (1) a list of the categories of personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to the customer, that a business has disclosed to third parties (including as defined by California Civil Code Section 1798.83 our affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third-parties’ direct marketing purposes, and (2) the names and addresses of all such third parties. We will respond to such written requests within 30 days following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address specified below under “Contact Us”. If we receive your request at a different e-mail or mailing address, we will respond within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 150 days from the date received. Please note that we are required to respond to each customer only once per calendar year. </p>
            <p><strong>Non-Discrimination.</strong> If you choose to exercise any of the rights detailed in this Notice, we will not discriminate against you in any way as a result of that exercise, including by offering you different pricing or products or by providing you with a different level of quality of products. </p>
            <p><strong>Notice of Financial Incentive.</strong> We may offer programs, benefits, sweepstakes or other offerings related to the collection or retention of personal information which may be deemed a “financial incentive” under the CCPA. Consumers who elect to participate in financial incentive programs (such as reward programs, limited-time promotions, sweepstakes, or contests) may be asked to provide personal information such as your name, email address, physical address, and or phone number. We may also collect commercial information such as credit card numbers and payment information (in limited circumstances), details of transactions that you carry out through our services, including products purchased or considered, and wine club information from consumers who elect to participate in a rewards program. The details of each program or offering are described in the applicable terms and conditions. </p>
            <p>Under the CCPA, the incentives we offer in exchange for the opportunity to market to you may be considered financial incentives. The value of the information you provide as part of a program will vary based on the program in which you participate and the number of consumers who chose to participate. We have made the determination that the CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer is reasonably related to the value of your personal information, and we provide written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time but you may lose access to the relevant incentive. If you wish to opt-out, you may do so by sending your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@thewinegroup.com">privacy@thewinegroup.com</a>. </p>

If we cannot verify your identity, we will not provide or delete your PII. </p>

            <h3><strong>Authorized Agents</strong></h3>
            <p>You may submit a request through an authorized agent using the same methods available to you.

            <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

            <h3><strong>15. Indemnity</strong></h3>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each Company Party from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses and fees (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising out of or relating to (a) your use of, or activities in connection with, the Site (including Your Submissions); or (b) any violation or alleged violation of this Agreement by you.</p>

            <h3><strong>17. Jurisdictional Issues</strong></h3>
            <p>The Site is controlled or operated (or both) from California, United States, and is not intended to subject Company to any non-U.S. jurisdiction or law. The Site may not be appropriate or available for use in some non-U.S. jurisdictions. Any use of the Site is at your own risk, and you must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in doing so. We may limit the Site’s availability at any time, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction that we choose.</p>

            <h3><strong>18. Governing Law; Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</strong></h3>
            <p>This Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Site (including all Transactions), and all related matters are governed solely by, and construed solely in accordance with, the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to its principles of conflicts of law that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Site (including all Transactions) and all related matters, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class arbitration or class action. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (currently available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowProperty?nodeId=/UCM/ADRSTAGE2021425&revision=latestreleased" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowProperty?nodeId=/UCM/ADRSTAGE2021425&revision=latestreleased</a>), as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if applicable law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.</p>
